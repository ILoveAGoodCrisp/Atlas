#features

H3Script provides syntax highlighting for the following types:

- Commments
- Numbers
- Strings
- Operators
- Booleans
- Class (i.e. Script / Global types)
- Script type (i.e. startup, static...)
- Enumerated values, such as 'heroic' which represents a number
- Value types (i.e. void, real, ai...)
- Engine globals, which are global variables that can be used without the user needing to declare them (i.e. game_speed, ai_current_actor)
- HaloScript functions (i.e. ai_place, object_create...)
- Script names, the extension will apply highlighting to words which refer to a user defined script name.
